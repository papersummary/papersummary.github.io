## PaperSummary

*PaperSummary* is a simple Jekyll based website for organizing paper summaires. It is heavily inspired from [Carte](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/carte), which again inspired from [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com/) and [I/O docs](http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs). Fork it, and add your summaries in *_posts*, and also add your own list of conferences into *assets.css*.
