### Goal
- Examine Model Decisions
- Connect Decisions to Samples: internal states to relevant training samples
- Test Alternative Decisions: what-if explorations

### Method 
- Translation View
- Neighborhood View
- Global Encodings and Comparison Mode
- Interating with Examples
- Design Iterations

### Contributions
- facilitate deep exploration of all stages of a seq2seq model

### Limitations
- integration of the tool with other ML frameworks
